### What is event delegation?


Event delegation in JavaScript is a technique where you attach a single event handler to a parent element instead of individual handlers to its child elements. The event "bubbles" up from the child to the parent, triggering the handler. It helps handle events efficiently, especially for dynamic or numerous elements, reducing memory usage and improving performance.
